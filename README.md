# reinforcementLearning

In this project, I tested the openAI gym environments for reinforcement learning. Therefore, I implemented an abstract agent class which can act and learn (update Q-table, NN, ...) depending on an observation (state of the environment) from the environment.
For a great introduction into reinforcement learning, see the [Tutorials](https://medium.com/emergent-future/simple-reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow-part-0-q-learning-with-tables-and-neural-networks-d195264329d0) by Arthur Juliani.

Using this abstract definition of an agent, I implemented the four most common (and simple) agents:
1. A random acting agent: The singlest agent. Independent on the observation it performs a random action and does not learn.
2. An agent exploiting a Q-Tabular:
3. An agent with a (single layer) neural network
4.
